```bash
history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | head
```

- `uniq -c` remove duplicated lines, and add count at the beginning of that line
- `sort -k1nr` start a key at position 1, numeric-sort, reverse

And the wordcount:
```bash
cat words.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | sed '/^$/d' | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'
```
